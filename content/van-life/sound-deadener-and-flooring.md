The first thing we did to our new van was to add some Noico sound deadener to the metal panels.  This stops a lot of the resonance that the larger panel sections are pron to and drastically reduces noise.  We ordered 2 boxes of the 80 mil 36 sqft Noico and it worked out almost perfectly to do the walls, ceiling, above the front headliner, inside the side and rear door panels and inside the passenger seat pedestal (to help with noise from our Chinese diesel heater).

All you need to do this is a sharp knife, a straight edge, sharpie, a roller, something to cut on, gloves so you don't get cut from the metal edges and a cheap trim removal kit to get the door panels and foam blobs off.  We left the doors and area above the headliner to last as we wanted to wait for the Thinsulate insulation to show up so we could do both at the same time.



Next step was the flooring.  This turned out to be pretty straight forward and we were very happy with the results.  We followed the basic flooring guide from Faroutride.com.  We used some of our Noico sound deadener in the large valleys as well as some 1/2" plywood pieces in the large depressions so that the foam boards had a solid surface all around and wouldn't flex over low spots.  We used Silicon2  to attach the plywood to the metal floor.  On top of this we put a layer of 1" foam XPS from home depot held to the van floor with Silicon2 again.  Then we added a layer of 1/2" baltic birch from Windsor Plywood on top using biscuits in the joins between the plywood pieces to keep them aligned.  PL300 adheres the plywood to the XPS boards.  We then added a bunch of weight onto everything overnight to help it all set up.  A big part of all this was making a good template of the floor.  We used some scrap amazon cardboard and brown paper to do this.  It took a while to trace out and cut but it made the rest so much easier it was time well spent.
