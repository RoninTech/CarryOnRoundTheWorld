A big right of passage when DIY'ing a van is the roof fan installation.  There's nothing like cutting a gaping hole in a brand new van.  No pressure!  :)  I highly recommend you pick up a decent metal jigsaw blade.  I believe the one I used was 25 teeth per inch and it cut the sheet metal like butter even with an old jigsaw.  I also recommend watching as many YouTube videos as you can stomach on this as there's a lot of good ideas (and what not to do) out there, they're just spread out.  We decided to install the fan above the bed to maximize the room we will have for solar panels in front of the fan.  The fan's cover encroaches rearward so if you mount it in the front of your van's roof, you lose a bit more roof space.   Between the roof fan and our [unobtainium window vents](https://www.eurocampers.com/2015--2020-Ford-Transit-Full-Size-Van-Airvent-Cab-Window-Inserts-2pc-set--includes-both-sides-_p_1716.html) we hope to get some decent ventilation.
