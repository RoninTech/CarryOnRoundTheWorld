When we first found the van we were very excited as it was well kitted out for a camper van build based on our 4 months of van life living.  Things like:
- Extended fuel tank means 31 gallons/117L to go further before re-fueling.  6 gallons/27L over standard.
- Swivel seats for Driver and passenger make maximum use of available space.
- 350 means 9500 GVWR suspension for handling build weight.
- Adaptive cruise is great for long drives.  We'll never own a vehicle without this again.
- Big 8" Sync 3 Display makes navigating and reversing easier.

The van has been completely insulated for sound and temperature using Noico sound deadening mat and 60 sqft of 3M SM600L Thinsulate.  All door panels and headliners were removed for full coverage.  Insulated flooring has also been installed with 1" XPS foam, 1/2" baltic birch plywood and vinyl flooring.  A final touch on the flooring as the installation of the Ford HD scuff plate kit for side and rear doors.

The roof is setup for 400W of solar panels with 80/20 roof rails installed into the factory attachment points.  Solar panels and mounting pieces are available and ready to be installed for purchaser at costs detailed below.

A true 2KW diesel heater is installed beneath the passenger seat and a 5100K white Maxxfan in the rear of the van roof.  These combined with the [Transit Van Cab Window Air Vent Inserts](https://vanupgrades.com/products/transit-van-cab-window-air-vent-inserts) make a great combination.  An upgraded diesel heater controller ([the Afterburner](http://www.mrjones.id.au/afterburner/)) is included to make best use of the heater.

Last item to be installed was a removable East West sliding bed to maximize interior space usage.  If this doesn't match your desired layout then it is a simple matter to remove and start your own.
