## 2020 Ford Transit 350 AWD Ecoboost High Roof 148" Cargo, 7000 KM

## $XX,XXX

Here is the window sticker for the van that we purchased new off the lot in 2020, showing all of the options:

When we first found the van we were very excited as it was well kitted out for a camper van build based on our 4 months of van life living.  Things like:
- Extended fuel tank - Means 31 gallons to go further before re-fueling.  6 gallons over standard.
- Swivel seats - Driver and passenger seats swivel making maximum use of available space.
- 350 - Means 9500 GVWR suspension for handling build weight.
- Adaptive cruise - Great for long drives.  We'll never own a vehicle without this again.
- 8" Sync 3 Display - Bigger screen makes navigating and reversing easier.

Other things just make life easier such as:
- Remote start from App or fobs.
- HD trailer package with integrated controller.
- Keyless entry pad.
- Reverse camera.
- Android Auto and Apple phones fully supported.
- BLIS blind spot and reverse sensors.
- Dual batteries beneath driver seat.
- Extended length running boards.
- Autolamp magically controls high beams at night.


The van has been completely insulated for sound and temperature using Noico sound deadening mat and 60 sqft of 3M SM600L Thinsulate.  All door panels and headliners were removed for full coverage.  Insulated flooring has also been installed with 1" XPS foam, 1/2" baltic birch plywood and vinyl flooring.  A final touch on the flooring as the installation of the Ford HD scuff plate kit for side and rear doors.

The roof is setup for 400W of solar panels with [80/20 roof rails installed into the factory attachment points](https://carryonrtw.com/van-life/roof-racks/).  Solar panels and remaining rack pieces are all available and ready to be installed.

A true 2KW diesel heater is installed beneath the passenger seat and a 5100K white Maxxfan in the rear of the van roof.  These combined with the [Transit Van Cab Window Air Vent Inserts](https://vanupgrades.com/products/transit-van-cab-window-air-vent-inserts) make a great combination.  An upgraded diesel heater controller ([the Afterburner](http://www.mrjones.id.au/afterburner/)) is included to make best use of the heater.

Last item to be installed was a [removable East West sliding bed](http://carryonrtw.com/van-life/east-west-sliding-bed/) to maximize interior space usage.  If this doesn't match your desired layout then it is a simple matter to remove and start your own.

## Tons of info and pictures are available in the articles we wrote for van work.  See the bottom of [this page](https://carryonrtw.com/van-life/) for all the links.

## [Contact us here](https://carryonrtw.com/contact/) with any questions or interest.

Here is a list of all of the items that have been installed so far and how much they cost:

Here is a list of all of the parts waiting to be used on the van.  Ideally we would like to sell everything together but we would also be open to selling items individually:
