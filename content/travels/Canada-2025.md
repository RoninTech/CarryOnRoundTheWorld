When we were in Chiang Mai deciding on our plans for 2025, a return to Canada came up. The opportunity to see our families and friends plus take care of whatever was required was appealing. We started looking at flights using Aeroplan miles, which has been much more challenging lately. I naively stated, it isn’t that hard to find something good with another airline and was advised it’s not so simple and much more difficult than I knew. Somewhat daunted, I said no harm in looking!  Fate must have favoured me since about half an hour later I found a really good BKK-TPE-YVR flight with Thai and EVA Air. After we got over the surprise, we verified the flights actually existed and booked them. The flight from BKK was changed several times, so we had just under 2 hours to make our connection in TPE, but felt we could manage since our duffle would be checked to YVR. 

Our flight from BKK-TPE was delayed which wasn’t a great start but we were able to wait in the lounge. Boarding was a further delay when we had to get bussed out to the plane and spent another 15 minutes waiting before we could board. Eventually, we departed but this narrowed our connection time to about 30 minutes. It was all booked on one ticket and Paul was confident they'd either have someone meet us, a perk of business class, or they’d have to rebook us. The flight itself was fine, it was a smaller plane with no pods, but the seats were comfortable and Thai Airways service is still great. When we landed, it was another wait for a bus, get driven to the terminal. Paul was right, there were several people with signs to escort people to tight connections. Our host told us we had to walk quickly, which we did and luckily made it to the gate as they were finishing general boarding. 

We settled in our pods, meals selected and jammies handed out quickly. We had the single pods by the windows and Paul’s was just in front of me. Across the aisle, I had Desmond otherwise known as the “jack-in-the-box”. He kept standing up, standing by his seat, going up the aisle, back down, hitting the call button. Turns out he is from England, is 92 and was traveling back to Canada with his wife and daughter. His wife was fast asleep behind him, but later told me they met in Vietnam back in the 70’s, immigrated to Canada in the 80’s and now that he had dementia they had made one last trip to see family in Vietnam. I think the attendants thought I was traveling with him so had me help with explaining things and getting him settled. I helped with his seatbelt, explained what was meant when they asked about his bed and helped him with his cane. To be honest, this meant it wasn’t the most restful fight, but that’s on me as I could have said we were not traveling together. I do think his family should have been more attentive and seated closer as he was obviously confused and struggling. Regardless, we made it back to YVR. 

We quickly got our luggage and headed off to the airport Fairmont for the night. We were heading to Creston for the first few weeks so had a flight to YXC early the next morning. For the past month we had been checking the prices of the hotel and managed to get a really good deal by booking about a week out. We managed to get some sleep, had a quick breakfast at the airport before catching our last flight. Paul’s parents met us in Cranbrook, we loaded up the luggage and Paul drove us back to Creston. We had a tour of the garden, got pizza from Jimmy’s and a nice catch up on the front deck before having an early night. 

We hadn’t totally decided where to base ourselves for the summer but it quickly became apparent that having us there longer term was too much for Paul’s parents. We started looking at rentfaster and got in touch with Diana, our landlord from [last summer](https://carryonrtw.com/travels/calgary-summer-2024/). It worked out great as the guy who moved in when we left, was leaving so the apartment was available. We jumped on it and arranged to take possession for May 23.  

The next few weeks were filled with spending time with Paul’s parents and helping them with whatever they needed. Paul sorted out computers, the tv’s, helping with taking down larger branches, clearing out the garage and dump runs. I did cooking, cleaning, helped sort out some banking and paperwork and started weeding the garden plot. We also moved everything on the front deck and gave it a good clean on one of the non-rainy days. We managed to see Pati and John a few times which was great. We met at Bassack one night, walked over to theirs for dinner and boardgames and met for lunch. It was great to see them and hear that they were considering a trip to Thailand. We fired up the BBQ for a few meals, played Domino’s and had some evenings on either porch watching the birds. 

We were able to borrow the car and take a trip to Calgary to take possession of the apartment and drop off some stuff that we’d need. Pati and John were in town so they came over and we went out for dinner. We made it a quick overnight so that we were back in Creston so that Paul and John could watch the last game of the season together and see Liverpool be presented with the PL trophy! It was a nice way to wind up our stay. John came to see us off at the airport, Paul drove us there so that John only had to drive back. It’s a long way to go by himself. Our flight was on time and we landed in Calgary. 

The apartment was the same, nicely furnished and had everything we needed. Nadir was still at the front desk so it was nice to see him. We did some grocery orders, went to the store and got organized and unpacked. Our goal in Calgary was to get our gear sorted, traveling with the duffle had reminded us that carry on only was the way to go, so we were going to need to dial in some items. We were also able to make some appointments to connect with our financial people, accountants and get some of that sorted. We also wanted to get back to walking, get some overdue vaccines and get ourselves sorted. 

We had told my Mom that we were going to come visit her at the beginning of June, but hadn’t set a date. We surprised her one day by walking over, called her when we arrived and told her to look out the window. She was even more surprised to hear that we’d be staying for the summer. We settled into a routine, a couple of times a week, I’d walk over earlier in the morning, Paul would come a few hours later and we’d walk back together. We helped my Mom get sorted with a new Telus contract, internet and mobility for seniors which saved her a lot of money overall. We managed to get the facility manager to install the new stove she had been promised over 9 months prior and ordered her air fryer since that would make it even easier. I was able to be there to take my Mom to the hospital when she wasn’t feeling well. Not how I wanted to spend my birthday, but glad we were there when she needed us and could get her taken care of. 
We got in touch with friends and made numerous lunch and dinner dates. Tic came back to Canada, so we got to meet with her and Jesse when they were heading to BC. We saw Curtis, Tina, Dave, Brenda and Kirby at the Pig & Duke. I walked over to Kensington to have lunch with Roberta… thankfully she forgave me after I messed up and ended up messing up our first arranged day.  We are meeting Slavin, Alex and Valens for dinner at a Mexican restaurant and then John and Mark for another Pig & Duke evening. Hopefully we get to see everyone at least once more. 

Paul ordered one of the new mini computers. We ended up with 2 due to some issues with Amazon but were able to get everything resolved and returned. I got a Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 which tracks sleep, steps and all sorts of things. We’ve learned that letting the battery get too low will have you woken up at 4 am with it making a death knell when it drops to below 5%. 

So far it’s rained a lot through June and July. There has been summer snow in the mountains and we've dropped down to 6 C a couple of nights. The average rain in July is 65ml, before the month is over we’ve already hit over 100ml which resulted in some flood warnings. The cooler days have made for some nice walks, less smoke and justify a trip to the local Vietnamese for a bowl of tasty Pho. The city was crazy busy during Stampede, it wasn’t quite the record year but it was close. We didn’t attend the festivities but were able to see the fireworks every night which were good. 

We booked flights back to Thailand for September 22, we have to be in YVR on the 21st since it’s the usual 2:00 AM departure on EVA Air. We have the apartment until September 15 so arranged to go see Paul’s parents for the time in between. We’ll be renting a car to take the stuff back and then flying to Cranbrook, spend the week in Creston before heading back to Thailand.
