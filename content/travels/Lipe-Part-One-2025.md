Lipe: Feb 8-27/25

With our lease ending and not wanting to miss it two years in a row, we headed to Lipe. We had gotten in contact with Mikkel and arranged a room at The Reef. Nok arranged our taxi and ferry, so everything went smoothly. We had spoken to Tic who was kind enough to let us store our duffle at her cousin's shop at the pier. We didn’t want to haul it all the way to the Lipe since we wouldn’t need anything from it. We had an easy trip to Pak Bara, checked in at the SeeSea, dropped the duffle at the shop and headed over to Barista Cafe for dinner. The next morning, it was the early boat to Lipe which was one of the smoother rides we’ve had. 

After a cheeky arrival beverage, we checked in at The Reef and had some lunch. Kristopher came to see up and we headed over to the beach for a bevvie. We stopped to say hi when we saw Nunzia at Varin. As we were chatting, a head popped up a few feet away on the beach and there was Robin, so we got to say hello. It was quite funny that they had not noticed each other. We had a quick chat before heading down the beach to sit at Tony’s where we had a nice visit with Kristopher. We had dinner at Nee Papaya before heading over to Passion to see Rob and Laura, ending at Corner with Tic and Jesse. Another great first night on Lipe ✅.  

The theme of the trip was everyone was either getting over being sick, was still going through it or various combinations of the prior. It ran through all our friends but we were still out and about and enjoying being back. Over the next few days we got to spend some time with Mikkel, Nok and Darvin. Simon and Lydia were with their girls in the room next door. Visited with Oh and Su and headed to say hi at our favorite places. Odne showed up a couple of days later so we were able to spend more time with him as well. Rob and Laura introduced us to their friends Kevin and Scott, who Rob had known for years. We usually met up at some point during the night with everyone together for at least one beverage. We were able to get on a boat trip with Captain Kiang and had a great time. Ness and P’ur came for a whirlwind weekend and were able to join us on a boat trip and night at Corner. We got to help celebrate Robin’s birthday, safe to say, he had a pretty epic night. We saw Soeng play several times and ended most nights at Passion or Corner. Odne and Kristopher joined us for numerous footie games at OMG. We had some really great nights out seeing everyone and just enjoying being back.                           

Inevitably, the germs were passed around and Paul ended up getting sick. Not wanting to spread more germs, he spent 10 days just going between our room and Mojo. With help from Nok and Su, we found the “soup lady” and I made several trips for soup or kebabs when he didn't feel up to leaving the room. It ended up that he had to go to the doctor and get some antibiotics as it just wasn’t clearing up. I went out to Passion to see Laura, Rob, Odne and crew for a cheeky G&T. We had planned our next stop as KUL to set ourselves up for Tasmania and made the decision to head there about a week earlier. We figured it would give him time to rest and be over it before we hit the ground running in Tassie. Paul was up to a meal with Odne before he headed home, we were able to have dinner with Mikkel and Nok as well. On our final night we hit up the new 10 Moons with Rob, Laura, Tic and Jesse for a “see you next time” meal and had a nice dinner. We decided to spend a night in Hat Yai so took the later boat which was nice. The trip was fairly smooth and we rested up, repacked for the flight to KL the next day.

KUL: February 28-March 6 

Our flight was smooth and we headed to our Airbnb. It was a gong show… long story short they gave us the wrong entry code, said we didn’t have a booking, the place wasn’t clean, had a horrible smell so we bailed to a new place the next day. This one was great, clean and comfortable. Paul was feeling better but I ended up getting sick. We found a new breakfast place, they were on Grab so we could get it delivered. It was close enough that when Paul felt better, he could walk over and pick up it along with a stop at Optimist for a coffee. He went and got me some medicine and we can say chocolate flavoured cough syrup isn’t as good as you might think. Other than that, we did some laundry, rested and tried to get organized for Tasmania.
