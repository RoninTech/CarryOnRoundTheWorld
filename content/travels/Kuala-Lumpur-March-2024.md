When making our travel plans in [2023](https://carryonrtw.com/travels/decision-2023/) we had about 6 weeks between dropping off Skippy in Perth and heading back to Canada. We had found the best value for flights was with Air Asia PER-KUL so had booked the flights to depart near the end of March. During our travels in Australia and New Zealand we discussed if we wanted to spend time traveling around Malaysia or would we prefer to settle somewhere… settling somewhere won. Our friends, Ness and Ian, have a condo in Hua Hin, Thailand. We had often discussed checking it out to see what it was like, we'd never been before.  They had offered to let us stay previously but the timing never worked out. When we contacted them, the dates worked as they weren’t going to be using the condo.  We could get a tourist visa from the Thai embassy in Kuala Lumpur, great flights to Bangkok and from there it was a short 3 hour taxi to Hua Hin…  so we had a plan. 

The problem with booking flights so far in advance is that the flights are often canceled which is exactly what happened. While waiting for the rain to end in [Franz Josef, New Zealand] we were advised our March 23 flight to KL was canceled. They could book us on another flight later in the week, but that didn’t really work because we wouldn’t have enough time to get visas and would have to spend longer in Perth and hotels in Australia are quite expensive. We spent several hours looking at options, found a flight with a different airline that worked and tried to book it. Turns out we were very fortunate the website didn’t work and we couldn’t process the transaction… found out later the airline had a horrible safety record.

In the end, we found a flight to KL with AirAsia about a week earlier and were able to change it online, no fees. It did mean we had to change Skippy's return date as well, but that was easily done. It was also really easy to get a flight from BKK-TPE and we could book with EVA Air, connecting our tickets through to YYC. This would give us 37 days in Thailand before heading for our flights to Canada. While we were traveling in the van our retirement extensions for Thailand had lapsed so our options were we could enter visa exempt and do an extension or get a tourist visa. The week in KL allowed us to get the tourist visa and meant we didn’t have to spend time at immigration during our stay but it all hinged on having the earlier flight to KL. It felt like a lot of maneuvering, but in the end we got it done. Ness and Ian were super helpful, sending documents to make getting the visa easier and arranging the ride to the apartment in Hua Hin. 

Our flight to KL was smooth. It took us a while to navigate the airport between walking from the gate, getting a sim, getting a Grab taxi but we made it to the Airbnb without issue. I only made the entry alarm at the building go off 3 times per day. We had a decent Airbnb that was walking distance to the KLCC Suria Centre, the dentist and Thai embassy. We decided we needed a walk so went to KLCC to grab some breakfast for the morning and check out the food court for dinner. Funny, just after we sat down with a meal it started pouring. We ended up wandering around for an hour until the rain ended since we didn't have umbrellas. We had an appointment at the Thai embassy for the next day so we were up early and went with documents in hand.  It took maybe 20 minutes for them to make sure we had everything, we paid and were told to pick up our passports the next day. When we went back for pick up, again, it was really quick and we had visas in hand.

The rest of our time was pretty uneventful. When walking to the embassy we had found a great coffee spot so had that sorted for the daily, sometimes twice daily, fix. We went to the [KL City Dentists](https://www.klcitydentists.com/), great again as usual and we both had successful cleanings. We managed to get some basic breakfast items at the grocery store. We did some chores like laundry and getting our duffle organized. We ordered Grab food, splitting between My Biryani House and a couple of donair places. Went to see Dune 2 in a pretty empty theater, a great movie. There was a Decathlon nearby so we walked over to check that out, stopping at the local Samsung store so Paul could look at the phones. Otherwise we spent time just walking around and enjoying not having to drive.  Next stop Thailand!
