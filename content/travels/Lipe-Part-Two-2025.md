Yep, a second trip to Koh Lipe was in the cards! While we were sitting in Huonville one day Paul commented that he didn’t feel he had enough time on Lipe when we were there in February. He had gotten sick and we ended up having to cut the trip short which wasn’t great. We had just about a month between Tasmania and Canada (surprise, we are going back for the summer) and we hadn’t decided where to go yet. Despite discussing some different options we kept coming back to Lipe. 

We started looking into flights and quickly remembered that Songkran, Thai New Year's, is in April and you don’t want to travel on those days. We knew we were going to be in KL having already booked flights from PER-KUL and it was an easy flight to HDY. We contacted our Airbnb host, Leo, to see if we could extend our stay a few more days, which wasn’t a problem. Next up, was to get in touch with Mikkel and Nok to see if they had any rooms. No problem! Then we booked flights from KUL-HDY, a night at the SeeSea and it was back to Lipe for us. Tik was able to let us leave the duffle at her cousin's shop again, which was great. We also booked the flights from HDY-BKK along with a night at the BKK Airport Hotel so we were sorted. All the photos are from Lipe, apartment photos in KL aren't that interesting. 

#### KUL, April 9 to 16, 2025:

After a quick shuttle to the airport, we got in the line up to drop the duffle. It was quite long, a combined check in luggage drop, but we had lots of time so it wasn't an issue. They were very strict, weighing everyone's carry on and making those that were over weight check them. One younger couple went off to the side and started layering up their clothes, no idea if it worked as we didn’t see them on the flight. We had some breakfast and a coffee before our easy flight from PER to KUL. Our row only had two seats so it was perfect as the plane was packed. Flight was smooth with no issues. Usual easy process to get through immigration and get a Grab down to the Airbnb. Leo’s apartment is nice, we had stayed the prior year, so were familiar with the building. Luckily we were both healthy this time! We had a couple of days to relax, do laundry, walk over to KLCC and go out for breakfast and coffee. Our biggest plan here was a trip to the dentist since it was time for a cleaning and stopping in Decathlon. Easily done!

While here we saw a lot of comments about people with DTV’s getting stopped on entry to Thailand and asked for additional documents. That raised some concerns for us since we had switched to DTV’s the prior year. Paul found a print service nearby, so we loaded up our documents on a USB and headed over to get them printed. We did have a slight scare when we heard China’s President would be in town the day we were flying to HDY and some roads to and access around the airport would be restricted.

#### Lipe, April 16 to May 7, 2025:
 
We headed out to the airport early due to the closures and made it there with no problems. We checked in, had a quick bite and waited by the gate. The flight was delayed a bit, but was smooth and we arrived back in Thailand with no issues. An incident between two passengers resulted in some entertainment while waiting in line at immigration, one of the officers was even called over to tell them to calm down. We made it through, no questions so didn’t have to break out our documents. We quickly got our luggage, met our driver and headed off to the SeeSea. After a walk and dinner, we sorted out the duffle and our packs before getting some sleep. 

A quick duffle drop, a short wait and we were on the speedboat back to Lipe. It felt good to be back and we made the right choice. Some places were already closed or closing for the season and it was much quieter in general. We were lucky to have dinner with Tik, along with a night out with Jesse and Kiang. Tomas and Romana were back on Lipe so we were able to see them several times, both for meals out and beverages. We were able to have several dinners with Nok, Mikkel and Darvin. We spent nights out at Corner, often with Mikkel, we got to talk to Lexi and hear Soeng play which was great. We saw Sam a couple of times and had a nice chat. Stopped in for a beer at Home Bar to see our quiz friend. We had some nights at OMG for footie games and good meals. We were able to spend some time at Wapi and got lots of sun. Even headed over to Zodiac one night for a sunset. We saw Nee during our many visits to Nee Papaya, said hi to P’Chai at Thai Durm. We had a great meal with Tik and some of her family, Jesse, Tomas, Romana and Von at The Box. It was so good that we snuck in another meal for the two of us. On our last night, English Dave who we met during 2021 was back so we got to say hello. All in all, we were really glad to be back.

Had a bit of a bumpy ride back to the mainland but it was fine. We arranged a night in Hat Yai, deciding to check out the old Centara. Sadly, it's really showing it's age and the breakfast has gone downhill so we won't be back. We spent the afternoon at Central seeing the latest Avengers movie, diner and getting some last minute items. The next day was a short flight to BKK. The airport hotel switched to the Hyatt, which didn’t change the room, but vastly improved the breakfast. We rested, packed and got ready for our flight back to Canada.
