This was a very short visit… less then a week in all. We decided we needed to see the dentist for a cleaning, it had been a year! That and we liked the food and comforts of Kuala Lumpur. There was a lot more caution around travel at this point, people were wearing masks and using sanitizer. We had tried to get some masks but they were sold out everywhere.

When we arrived, our first idea was to get some soup from KLCC, but we were to be disappointed as our favorite place from last time had closed. We had a disappointing lunch and headed off to the dentist. It was another great experience and we were happy to get our teeth done.

We still weren’t able to get masks so when we went to the mall for lunch we were very careful not to touch things. We did find another soup place and decided we needed to see the aquarium. We got tickets on line and went over to KLCC to the aquarium. We had to be temperature tested before we could go in. The aquarium was interesting yet sad… near the beginning we saw otters that didn’t seem very happy. We saw lots of fish of all different sorts some in smaller tanks or various larger ones. There was a moving walkway through one area where you were in a tunnel and there was water all around you. There were sharks, rays and all sorts of fish there. For an aquarium they had done a good job and we spent a couple of hours there before heading back to our apartment. We basically ordered Grab Food from our favorite place every night, got some breakfast stuff in and were cautious about being out and about. The cases were rising from from the illness which was now called Covid 19. It was getting much worse and spreading faster than expected, so we were being cautious.

Other than the dentist and aquarium, we really spent the days relaxing and talking about if we needed to change plans, what are we going to do if this gets worse and looking forward to Lipe.
