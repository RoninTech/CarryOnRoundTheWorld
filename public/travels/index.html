      In January of 2019, while we were chilling in Kampot, Cambodia, we were trying to figure out what we would for the summer of 2019. Eventually we decided that we wanted to hike the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) from the Canadian border in Washington to the Mexican border near San Diego. So using our phones at 3AM in Cambodia we jumped online for the second permit lottery and got 2 permits for northbound PCT hikes.

      We had decided to head to Malaysia next, giving ourselves about a month before heading to Lipe. We went from Phnom Penh to Kuala Lumpur on Air Asia, it was a short flight. The airport in KL is massive but modern and we moved through everything quickly. We got sims and a Grab Taxi to downtown KL.
We booked a suite at Mercu Summer Suites, which are 99% AirBnb’s. It was a great location, close enough to get places by walking or Grab.

Our next stop was Vietnam… well, with a stop in Bangkok to get our Vietnamese visas. We decided to stay at the Vie again, partly because it was central to everywhere we needed to go and we deserved to be spoiled after Nepal! We were also able to spend an evening with Ben since he lived close enough to come into the area.
Ha Noi We arrived in Ha Noi on a Friday evening.

On our way to Nepal, yes we are going back to hike the Annapurna Circuit again, we decided to take a couple of days and spoil ourselves in Bangkok. We stayed at our favorite hotel, the Vie, pigged out on breakfast buffets, sushi and curries, did some shopping and slept.
We arrived in Kathmandu and headed back to Hotel Yala Peak for two nights. We went and got our permits and got organized.

      Sri Lanka! It wasn&rsquo;t originally on our radar but our friends, Judy and Carl, had raved about their experience there so we thought hmmm&hellip; why not? Plus the photos they had sent made it look really good and they were able to give us some great ideas on places to go. We&rsquo;d spent the summer back in Canada after coming home from 18 months of travel.
The Flights John and Rita dropped us off at the Cranbrook Airport so we could start our journey to Sri Lanka.

      There was a delay in getting our flight out of Kathmandhu, which isn&rsquo;t unusual apparently, but about an hour later, we were able to board the Air China flight to Chengdu. There were only 3 people in the business class area so we had room to spread out. We still think the co-pilot was also handling service but could be wrong. The flight was smooth and we landed in China! We had to get on a bus and were driven to the terminal, we were only transit passengers so expected to just go to the next gate.

Bangkok After an early morning departure from our Taipei AirBnB, we were outside waiting for the cab at 4:30 am. We are headed to Nepal with an over night in Bangkok. We decided to spoil ourselves and booked The Vie in Bangkok and even better, breakfast at The Vie. We spent the afternoon in Bangkok looking for gear for Nepal and going to a movie (Black Panther, meh&hellip;). After a nice supper at Muay Thai we headed back to pack and relax at our room.

      After the Philippines, we decided to do a stop in the Taiwan. A good friend of Helen&rsquo;s is from there and we know several people who really enjoyed it. We managed to get a good flight from Cebu, to Manila to Taipei on EVA air so off we went. We did have a little hitch thinking the flight departed Manila from the same terminal we arrived to from Cebu. Unfortunately not the case and after 20 minutes trying to figure it out we realized we had to head to terminal 3.

We decided after all our driving around in Oz and NZ, that we needed some beach time. We&rsquo;d heard so many awesome things and seen great photos so decided the Philippines was the next stop and used some of our precious mileage points to fly business class to Manila from Auckland. After some research, we didn&rsquo;t even leave the airport in Manila as it is supposedly a sketchy shithole, and just headed over to get a flight to Cebu.
